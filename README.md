Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) repository!
 
 # <h3>Introduction</h3>
This GitHub repository contains my practice codes during the 3rd semester of BSSE at COMSATS University Islamabad, Lahore Campus. You'll find implementations in C for various data structures and algorithms covering arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, graphs, searching and sorting algorithms and more. I have delved deep into these concepts to gain hands-on experience.All the codes neat and are written in well organized manner.

# <h3>Features</h3>
The repository includes implementations for the following Data structures and algorithms topics:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Heap Tree
- Graphs
- Search Algorithms (e.g., Binary Search, Linear Search)
- Sort Algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort.)
