# DSA
Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) repository!

This GitHub repo contains my practice codes during the 3rd semester of BSSE at COMSATS. You'll find implementations in C for various data structures and algorithms covering arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, graphs, searching and sorting algorithms and more.
In this GitHub repository, you'll find a bunch of practice codes and examples related to various data structures and algorithms. All the codes neat and are written in well organized manner.
